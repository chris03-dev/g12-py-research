# Python Research Project

This project contains the original (as well as recreated) files for my research project back in senior high school.

The original files exist solely to provide evidence of my past work.

The recreated source file serves to, well, recreate what I've done to analyse the colors of the image based on the pictures of the fruits, as well as to remove most if not all unecessary code.

## Setup

You may need to input the command below for the code to work:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## License

You may access the source files under the MIT license.

You may access the images in this project under CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0.
